You are gathering information before creating an execution plan.

USER REQUEST:
{user_message}

INFORMATION GATHERED SO FAR:
{gathered_info}

What additional information do you need? Respond with JSON:

{
  "type": "clarify",
  "questions": ["..."],
  "assumptions": ["..."],
  "needs_user_input": false,
  "reasoning": "..."
}

Guidelines:
- Only set needs_user_input=true if information CANNOT be obtained any other way
- Prefer making reasonable assumptions over blocking on user input
- Questions should be specific and actionable

Notes:
- File tool paths are always relative to the configured vault root; never ask for the vault root path.
